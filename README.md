# Hi, I'm Calvin

I'm a trainee astrophysicist with interests in **optical astronomy**, **radio astronomy**, and **data driven research**. My background includes work with globular clusters, colour–magnitude diagrams, variable stars, and hands-on radio astronomy training through the DARA programme.

I enjoy working at the intersection of science and data turning raw observations into insight. Recently, I’ve gained experience with **interferometry**, **radio data reduction**, **RFI analysis**, **Python-based pipelines**, and tools like **CASA**. I'm also exploring applications of **machine learning** and **anomaly detection** in astronomy.

### 🔭 What I'm currently learning
- ML techniques for anomaly detection in large datasets  
- Advanced Python workflows for astronomy  
- Cross-wavelength data analysis (optical + radio)

### 🧪 Projects I'm interested in
- Optical data analysis (CMDs, photometry, variable stars)  
- Wide field radio imaging  
- RFI characterization  
- ML in astronomy and survey science  

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- **Python**, NumPy, Matplotlib, Astropy  
- **CASA**, radio data reduction, interferometry  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Git & GitHub  
- Data cleaning and analysis

### 🎶 Outside of astronomy
I’m also a singer creativity plays a big role in how I think, solve problems, and communicate.
